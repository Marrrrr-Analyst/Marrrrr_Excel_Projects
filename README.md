# Marrrrr Project 1
 My project demostrates my Excel skills

This project focuses on creating a salary dashboard that primarily displays the median salary and job availability for associated job titles, job types, and countries. The adjustable variables make it useful for companies to easily find specific insights. This project is inspired by Luke Barousse, a YouTuber who teaches Excel for data analysts.
