# Marrrrr Project
These projects highlight my expertise in Excel, particularly in data analysis, visualization, and advanced data manipulation.

Project 1: I developed an interactive salary dashboard that allows users to analyze median salaries and job availability based on job titles, job types, and locations. This project demonstrates my ability to structure and visualize data effectively, making insights easily accessible. It is inspired by Luke Barousse, a well-known educator in Excel for data analysts.

Project 2: This project focuses on analyzing data-related jobs across all countries, including required skills and the likelihood of skills appearing in job postings. It showcases my proficiency in data cleaning and transformation using Power Pivot and Power Query, ensuring well-structured and meaningful insights.

Together, these projects demonstrate my ability to handle real-world datasets, apply data analysis techniques, and create actionable insights using Excel.
